# Re2cap
software for calculation of two layer soil resistivity

The RE2CAP program is free software (Freeware) that was designed and developed in principle for the area of electrical engineering so that it is a soil modeling tool in two layers from the inversion of parameters by numerical methods using for the effect a graphical interface. The results obtained can be used as a basis for grounding mesh designs. It is a simple and intuitive program.
