# RE2CAP

RE2CAP is free software (Freeware) that was designed and developed in principle for the area of electrical engineering so that it is a soil modeling tool in two layers from the inversion of parameters by numerical methods using for the effect a graphical interface. The results obtained can be used as a basis for grounding mesh designs. It is a simple and intuitive program.

## INSTALLATION

The installation of the RE2CAP program does not require a special procedure. The installer of the program contains the necessary files so that the program executes correctly. As a general rule, once the program is installed, the additional files in the created folder should not be moved.

### About the program

In this version, the program can calculate the soil model for Wenner and Schlumberger electric probes contemplating the use of two layers. For this the method of the descending gradient is used which is suggested in Std. IEEE 81 of 1983 and a method based on direct search is included.

The results obtained correspond to the resistivity values of the first and second layers, the depth of the first layer in meters and the percentage error of the theoretical model obtained with respect to the points measured in the field. A document is included in the form of a report of results, which can be exported in pdf format.
